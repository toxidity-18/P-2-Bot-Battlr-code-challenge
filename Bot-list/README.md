# BOT-LIST

Welcome to **BOT-LIST**, a React web application where you can build and manage your own bot army. As the galactic overlord, you can browse available bots, enlist them into your army, and discharge them as needed.

## Description

**BOT-LIST** is designed to allow users to:
- View a collection of available bots.
- Add bots to their personal army.
- Release bots from their army.
- Discharge bots from the system permanently.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (for as restful API)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <git@github.com:toxidity-18/P-2-Bot-Battlr-code-challenge.git>

    Navigate to the Project Directory

    bash

cd bot-battlr

Install Dependencies

Install the required npm packages:

bash

npm install

Set Up the JSON Server

    Create a db.json file in the project root directory with the following content:

    json

{
  "bots": [
    
    // Add more bots as needed
  ]

Install JSON Server globally if you havenâ€™t already:

bash

npm install -g json-server

Start the JSON Server:

bash

    json-server --watch db.json

The server will run on http://localhost:8002/bots.

Run the React Application

In a separate terminal window, start the React application:

bash

    npm start

    The application will open in your default web browser, typically at http://localhost:51713.
     
Usage

    BotCollection: View all available bots and add them to your army by clicking the "Add to Army" button.
    YourBotArmy: See the bots currently enlisted in your army. You can release them by clicking the "Release" button or discharge them permanently using the red "x" button.

Development

Feel free to contribute or modify the project as needed. Here are some key components:

    BotCard: Displays individual bot details and action buttons.
    BotCollection: Fetches and lists all bots from the JSON Server.
    YourBotArmy: Manages and displays the user's army of bots.
    App: Main component handling state and interactions between BotCollection and YourBotArmy.

Testing

Ensure all functionalities (viewing bots, adding to army, releasing, and discharging) work as expected. Make sure to test different scenarios to ensure robustness.
